Each of the arrays slowly take longer for the insert and append to go through. They are all
lightning fast but theres a slight change in each of them and how fast the code can run these
functions. I see that the append funciton runs much faster than the insert function, purely on
seeing the result of all 5, where the insert was going longer and longer, and append is roughly
staying tight between all 5.
